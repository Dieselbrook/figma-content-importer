Scene 2 (5-10s): Owner shows Happy Happies treat, dog's attention snaps into focus. Scene 3 (10-20s): Dog nails the command, gets the treat, celebration moment. Scene 4 (20-30s): Happy dog enjoying Happy Happies, text overlay: 'Training Wins Start Here'. Style: Authentic, relatable training moment (not overly polished). Real SA dog owner vibe (home, garden, backyard setting). Product clearly visible but not forced. Optional: trending audio or motivational sound. Alternative (if Reel not feasible): Static carousel showing before/during/after training moment with Happy Happies.",
