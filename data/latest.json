Leaf hunter or leaf ignorer? 👇\n\n#JOCKDogFood #AutumnDogs #DogMemes #DogHumour #SADogs #DogLife #RelatableDogMoments #DogLovers\n\n---\n\nIG: Autumn leaves: exist\n\nDogs: IS THIS A THREAT? 🍂😂\n\nDrop a 🍂 if your dog loses it over falling leaves\n\n#JOCKDogFood #AutumnDogs #DogMemes #DogHumour #SADogs #DogsOfSA #DogLife #RelatableDogMoments #FunnyDogs #DogsOfInstagram #DogLovers #PetHumour",

    "Visual_Brief": "Classic meme format — shareable, relatable, high-impact text. Option 1 (Single image): Dog mid-bark or mid-pounce at falling leaves (action shot). Text overlay: 'POV: Your dog discovering autumn leaves for the first time'. Autumn setting (SA garden, park, veld with fallen leaves). Option 2 (Split-screen meme): Top panel: Peaceful autumn scene with dog calmly sitting. Bottom panel: Same dog going absolutely feral at a single falling leaf. Text: 'Autumn vibes' vs 'My dog's autumn vibes'. Aesthetic: Real, candid dog photo (not staged). SA autumn setting (golden light, indigenous trees if possible). High contrast text for readability. No JOCK branding needed — pure engagement bait.",
